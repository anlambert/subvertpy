Upgrading from bzr-svn 0.4.x to 0.5.x
=====================================

If you'd like to keep using bzr-svn 0.4.x against your svn repo,
	set "default-mapping = v3".

else:
	If you have Subversion 1.5 and are admin, run bzr svn-set-revprops

	Any commits made by you from this point on will not have any bzr-specific 
	metadata when retrieved by bzr-svn 0.4.x and vice-versa.
