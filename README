Subvertpy
=========

Homepage: http://samba.org/~jelmer/subvertpy/

Python bindings for the Subversion version control system that are aimed to be
complete, fast and feel native to Python programmers.

Bindings are provided for the working copy, client, delta, remote access and
repository APIs. A hookable server side implementation of the custom Subversion
protocol (svn_ra) is also provided.

Differences with similar packages
---------------------------------
subvertpy covers more of the APIs than python-svn. It provides a more
"Pythonic" API than python-subversion, which wraps the Subversion C API pretty
much directly. Neither provide a hookable server-side.

Dependencies
------------
Subvertpy depends on Python 2.4 or later, and Subversion 1.4 or later. It should
work on Windows as well as most POSIX-based platforms (including Linux, BSDs
and Mac OS X).

A port to Python 3 is planned but has not happened yet. Patches are welcome.

Installation
------------
Standard distutils are used - use "setup.py build" to build and "setup.install"
to install. On most platforms, setup will find the Python and Subversion
development libraries by itself. On Windows you may have to set various
environment variables, see the next section for details.

Build instructions for Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Install the SVN dev kit ZIP for Windows from
  http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=91
  E.g. svn-win32-1.4.6_dev.zip
* Find the SVN binary ZIP file with the binaries for your dev kit.
  E.g. svn-win32-1.4.6.zip
  Unzip this in the *same directory* as the dev kit - README.txt will be
  overwritten, but that is all. This is the default location the .ZIP file
  will suggest (ie, the directory embedded in both .zip files are the same)
* Set SVN_DEV to point at this directory.
* Install the APR BDB and INTL packages - see README.txt from the devkit
* Set SVN_BDB and SVN_LIBINTL to point at these dirs.
