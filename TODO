mappingv4:
 - refuse to set fileprops on repository on which revprops have been set
 - skip looking for fileprops if revprops have been found in earlier revisions
 - implement set-svn-revprops command
 - implement layout functions, including command

todo:
- generate deltas rather than fulltexts when creating file id maps
- tests for setting svk:merge from .bzr checkout
- tests for http-specific SvnRaTransport._request_path() code
- more blackbox tests
 - svn-import without scheme specified should guess
 - bzr missing
- transform file ids in workingtree in svn-upgrade
- lookup_revision_id()'s result depends on the current branching scheme, 
  causing weird errors when pushing

.svn working trees:
- implement apply_inventory_delta()
- support merge without requiring revisions to be added to svn repository
- add tests for objects returned by WorkingTree.pull(), Branch.pull()
- don't update all entries to the same revnum when opening working tree
- when committing specific files in a lightweight checkout, make sure to 
  also commit the file property changes for the tree root
- faster "bzr status"

pushmerge:
 - create branches/ dir automatically

- Needs more tests
 - parents cache
 - Run all tests against repository with revprop changing allowed and without
- Needs upgrade command that can use legacy file properties and set revprops
- Support disabling legacy file property support somehow
- remove set revision properties settings
