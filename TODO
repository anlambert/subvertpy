 - implement layout functions, including command
 - allow skipping a revision completely - to allow creating branches using "svn cp"
 - create schemes from layouts rather than the other way around
  + remove Mapping.get_guessed_layout()

- generate deltas rather than fulltexts when creating file id maps

tests:
- more blackbox tests
 - svn-import without scheme specified should guess

.svn working trees:
- implement apply_inventory_delta()

- Needs more tests
 - Run all tests against repository with revprop changing allowed and without
