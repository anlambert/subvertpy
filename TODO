mappingv4:
 - skip looking for fileprops if revprops have been found in earlier revisions \
   AND server supports revprops AND mapping.supports_custom_revprops()
 - implement layout functions, including command
 - integrate svn-set-revprops into svn-upgrade ?
 - add options in commit for create_root, create_prefix
  - if create_root=False: skip _check_dirs_exist

todo:
- generate deltas rather than fulltexts when creating file id maps
- tests for http-specific SvnRaTransport._request_path() code
- more blackbox tests
 - svn-import without scheme specified should guess
 - bzr missing
- transform file ids in workingtree in svn-upgrade
- lookup_revision_id()'s result depends on the current branching scheme, 
  causing weird errors when pushing

.svn working trees:
- implement apply_inventory_delta()
- support merge without requiring revisions to be added to svn repository
- add tests for objects returned by WorkingTree.pull(), Branch.pull()
- don't update all entries to the same revnum when opening working tree
- when committing specific files in a lightweight checkout, make sure to 
  also commit the file property changes for the tree root
- faster "bzr status"

pushmerge:
 - create branches/ dir automatically

- Needs more tests
 - parents cache
 - Run all tests against repository with revprop changing allowed and without
- Needs upgrade command that can use legacy file properties and set revprops
- Support disabling legacy file property support somehow
