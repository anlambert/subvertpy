mappingv4:
 - implement layout functions, including command
 - add options in commit for create_root, create_prefix
  - if create_root=False: skip _check_dirs_exist
 - allow skipping a revision completely - to allow creating branches using "svn cp"

- generate deltas rather than fulltexts when creating file id maps
- transform file ids in workingtree in svn-upgrade

tests:
- more blackbox tests
 - svn-import without scheme specified should guess

.svn working trees:
- implement apply_inventory_delta()

- Needs more tests
 - Run all tests against repository with revprop changing allowed and without
- Needs upgrade command that can use legacy file properties and set revprops
- Support disabling legacy file property support somehow
