mappingv4:
 - implement layout functions, including command
 - create schemes from layouts rather than the other way around
  + remove Mapping.get_guessed_layout()
- fix update_after_commit test
- fix text parents

more tests:
- Run all tests against repository with revprop changing allowed and without
- performance tests (count roundtrips?)
- bzr:hidden
- bzr svn-set-revprops

performance:
- generate deltas rather than fulltexts when creating file id maps
- use replay and replay range to fetch revisions
